## Dev

Setup the required frameworks:

1. (pnpm)[https://pnpm.io/installation]
2. (Docker)[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/] (with Docker Compose)

Bootstrap the environment:

```
docker compose up -d
pnpm setup
```

Note: If you need to tweak default settings, `cp .env.example .env` and go to town.

Setup the database:

```
make create-db
pnpm db migrate
```

Create a local user to avoid setting up Google credentials:

```
pnpm cli users create you@example.com password -a
```

Load some mock data:

```
pnpm cli mocks load-all you@example.com
```

Run the dev server, which spins up both the `web` and the `api` services:

```
npm run dev
```
