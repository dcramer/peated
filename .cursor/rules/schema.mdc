# Whisky Schema Definitions

A set of common definitions for fields we use:

- **brand**: The brand or bottler of the whiskey.
- **distillery**: An **array** of distilleries where the whiskey was produced (e.g., \`[ "Macallan", "Highland Park" ]\` for a blend of multiple distilleries, or \`[ "Lagavulin" ]\` for a single distillery release). If the whiskey is an **official bottling** from a single distillery, return \`[ distillery_name ]\`. If it’s a blend with unknown distilleries, return \`[]\` (empty array). If it is an independent bottling, return the distillery name(s) in the array.
- **expression**: The specific name or expression of the whiskey.
- **series**: The series or collection name (if applicable, otherwise \`null\`).
- **category**: The category of the whiskey. One of \`blend\`, \`bourbon\`, \`rye\`, \`single_grain\`, \`single_malt\`, \`single_pot_still\`.
- **stated_age**: Age of the whiskey in years (integer, \`null\` if no age statement).
- **abv**: Alcohol by volume as a percentage (float, e.g., 43.0 for 43% ABV).
- **release_year**: The year the whiskey was bottled or released.
  - Extract if explicitly labeled as "Bottling Year," "Bottled in YYYY," "Release Year," or similar.
  - If no explicit label, extract any standalone four-digit year (YYYY) if it appears near ABV, batch, or edition information.
  - Ignore unrelated dates (e.g., distillery establishment year, government warnings).
  - If multiple years are listed (e.g., "Distilled in 1998, Bottled in 2018"), use:
    - vintage_year: 1998
    - release_year: 2018
  - If no valid year is found, set \`release_year\`: null.
- **vintage_year**: The distillation or vintage year (if given, otherwise \`null\`).
- **cask_type**: Primary cask type or finish (if mentioned, otherwise \`null\`).
- **edition**: Batch, edition, or release identifier (if mentioned, otherwise \`null\`).

### Normalization Guidelines

1. **Brand vs Distillery:**

   - If the whiskey is an official distillery bottling, **brand** is the distillery name, and **distillery** is an array containing the same name (e.g., \`"brand": "Macallan",\` \`"distillery": [ "Macallan" ]\`).
   - If the whiskey is a **blend** from multiple distilleries, **distillery** should list all known contributing distilleries (e.g., \`[ "Macallan", "Highland Park" ]\`).
   - If the distilleries are **unknown**, set \`distillery: []\` (empty array).
   - If the whiskey is an **independent bottling**, set **brand** to the bottler name (e.g., \`"Gordon & MacPhail"\` ) and **distillery** to the actual producer(s) (e.g., \`[ "Caol Ila" ]\` for a Gordon & MacPhail Caol Ila release).

2. **Age Statement Handling:**

   - If the label includes a stated age (e.g., \`"12 Years Old"\`), extract it as an integer (\`stated_age: 12\`).
   - If there is no age statement, return \`null\` (\`stated_age: null\` for NAS – No Age Statement).
   - When including the age statement as part of the expression, it should always be in this format: \`"12-year-old"\`

3. **ABV Extraction:**

   - Identify the ABV percentage and return it as a decimal (e.g., \`"abv": 46.3\` for \`"46.3% ABV"\`).

4. **Series and Edition Identification:**

   - If the whiskey is part of a named series (e.g., \`"Committee Release",\` \`"Limited Edition"\`), extract that into \`series\`.
   - If the label specifies an edition (e.g., \`"Batch 3",\` \`"2021 Release"\`), extract it into \`edition\`.

5. **Cask Type Extraction:**

   - If a maturation or finishing cask is mentioned (e.g., \`"Sherry Cask",\` \`"Bourbon Barrel"\`), include that in \`cask_type\`.

6. **Multiple Distilleries (Blends):**

   - If the label indicates that the whiskey is a **blend** of multiple distilleries, list all known names in \`distillery: [ "Distillery1", "Distillery2" ]\`.
   - If the distilleries are unspecified, leave \`distillery: []\` (empty array) instead of guessing.
   - If it's a **single malt**, ensure that **distillery** is an array with one value.

7. **Edge Case Handling:**

   - If a typo or near match is detected (e.g., "Ardbeg Supanova" instead of "Ardbeg Supernova"), correct it.
   - If a year is present but unclear (e.g., "2019" without context), use judgment but do **not fabricate details**.
   - If multiple dates are listed (e.g., "Distilled in 1998, Bottled in 2018"), use **vintage_year: 1998**, **release_year: 2018**.
